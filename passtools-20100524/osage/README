I am calling the query tool SAGE, at least for now.

It clearly ought to stand for something. The best I have so far is
"See Ancestry Groupings Easily".

However, a sage is a person who knows a lot, so it's appropriate even
if the acronym doesn't work.

If someone can think of a good overarching name, however, I wouldn't
be averse to making "sage" be a subsystem instead and naming other
subsystems after other spices used in Italian cooking; e.g. BASIL =
"basil, a simple interpreted language".
