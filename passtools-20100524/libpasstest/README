Version of the DPAPI lib meant for testing PA apps.

It logs the application-reported provenance to a file. The default
output name is "passtest.pt", but this can be changed by setting the
PASSTEST environment variable to some other file name.

The output format is that used by pesto.

Current limitations:

  - It will log records for and references to real files, but it doesn't
    declare them.

    (Nor, in general, can it do so reliably, without using ELF tricks
    to intercept close() and a few other calls, which, while possible,
    is a lot more elaborate than I'm willing to get right now.)

    This will cause the pesto tools to mostly refuse to process the
    output without hand-editing.


  - It does not keep track of versions. Objects read from are always
    version 1.


  - It is copied from the pesto DPAPI code and like that code does not
    handle multistring records. (Yet.)


  - The output will contain explicit versions if explicit versions
    appear in the xrefs sent to pawrite(). The pesto tools will not
    parse these.
